We are a specialty financecompany that invests primarily in
leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private U.S. middle-
market companies, which we define as companies having annual
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (
“EBITDA”) ofbetween $2&nbsp;million and $50&nbsp;million, both
through direct lending and through participation in loan
syndicates. Our investment objective is to generate current income
and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from our investments.
Ourinvestment activities are externally managed and advised by
Saratoga Investment Advisors, LLC, a New York-based investment firm
affiliated with Saratoga Partners, a middle market private equity
investment firm.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in leveraged
loans issued by middle market companies. Leveraged loans are
generally seniordebt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated
debt which are invested by companies with below investment grade or
“junk” ratings or, if not rated, would be rated below investment
grade or “junk” and, as a result, carry ahigher risk of default.
Leveraged loans also have the benefit of security interests on the
assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of, or be
junior to, other security interests. Term loans are loans that do
not allow the borrowers torepay all or a portion of the loans prior
to maturity and then <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">re-borrow</font> such repaid amounts under the
loan again. We also purchase mezzanine debt and make equity
investments in middle market companies.Mezzanine debt is typically
unsecured and subordinated to senior debt of the portfolio
company.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
While our primary focus is to generatecurrent income and capital
appreciation from our debt and equity investments in middle market
companies, we may invest up to 30.0% of our portfolio in
opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to
stockholders. Such investmentsmay include investments in distressed
debt, including securities of companies in bankruptcy, foreign
debt, private equity, securities of public companies that are not
thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as
collateralized loanobligation funds. Although we have no current
intention to do so, to the extent we invest in private equity
funds, we will limit our investments in entities that are excluded
from the definition of “investment company”
underSection&nbsp;3(c)(1) or Section&nbsp;3(c)(7) of Investment
Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”), which includes private equity
funds, to no more than 15% of its net assets.</p>

As of February&nbsp;28, 2018, we had total assets of
$360.3&nbsp;million and investments in 31 portfolio companies and
an additionalinvestment in the subordinated notes of one
collateralized loan obligation fund, Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2013-1,</font> Ltd. (“Saratoga CLO”
), which had a fair value of $11.9&nbsp;million as
ofFebruary&nbsp;28, 2018. The overall portfolio composition as of
February&nbsp;28, 2018 consisted of 57.6% of first lien term loans,
27.7% of second lien term loans, 1.2% of syndicated loans, 4.8% of
structured finance securities and 8.7% of equityinterests. As of
February&nbsp;28, 2018 the weighted average yield on all of our
investments, including our investment in the subordinated notes of
Saratoga CLO and Class&nbsp;F notes tranche of the Saratoga CLO,
was approximately 11.1%. Theweighted average yield of our
investments is not the same as a return on investment for our
stockholders and, among other things, is calculated before the
payment of our fees and expenses. As of February&nbsp;28, 2018, our
total return based on netasset value per share was 14.45% and our
total return based on market value was 5.28%. As of
February&nbsp;28, 2017, our total return based on net asset value
was 12.62% and our total return based on market value was 80.83%.
Total return based onNAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus
dividends (distributed from net investment income) per share paid
during the period assuming participation in the Company’s dividend
reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share.
Totalreturn based on market value is the change in the ending
market value of the Company’s common stock plus dividends
(distributed from net investment income) paid during the period
assuming participation in the Company’s dividendreinvestment plan
divided by the beginning market value of the Company’s common
stock. While total return based on NAV and total return based on
market value reflect fund expenses, they do not reflect any sales
load that may be paid byinvestors. As of February&nbsp;28, 2018,
approximately 100.0% of our first lien debt investments were fully
collateralized in the sense that the portfolio companies in which
we held such investments had an enterprise value or our investment
had anasset coverage equal to or greater than the principal amount
of the related debt investment. The Company uses enterprise value
to assess the level of collateralization of its portfolio
companies. The enterprise value of a portfolio company isdetermined
by analyzing various factors, including EBITDA, cash flows from
operations less capital expenditures and other pertinent factors,
such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company’s securities
or other liquidation events. As aresult, while we consider a
portfolio company to be collateralized if its enterprise value
exceeds the amount of our loan, we do not hold tangible assets as
collateral in our portfolio companies that we would obtain in the
event of a default. Ourinvestment in the subordinated notes of
Saratoga CLO represents a first loss position in a portfolio that,
at February&nbsp;28, 2018, was composed of $310.4&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of predominantly senior secured first
lien termloans. A first loss position means that we will suffer the
first economic losses if losses are incurred on loans held by the
Saratoga CLO. As a result, this investment is subject to unique
risks. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Ourinvestment in Saratoga
CLO constitutes a leveraged investment in a portfolio of
predominantly senior secured first lien term loans and is subject
to additional risks and volatility.”</p>

interest, including default interest, outstanding under our

We have entered into an investment advisory and management
agreement (the “Management Agreement”) with Saratoga Investment

Management Agreement was for two years from its effective date of
July 30, 2010, with automatic, <font STYLE=

by our board ofdirectors, a majority of whom must be our

management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is
calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, which
includes assets purchased withborrowed funds but excludes cash and
cash equivalents. As a result, Saratoga Investment Advisors will
benefit as we incur debt or use leverage to purchase assets. Our
board of directors will monitor the conflicts presented by this

may incur.</p>

fees that we receive from portfolio companies) earned during the

The second part of the incentive fee is determined andpayable in
arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of
the Management Agreement) and equals 20.0% of our “incentive fee
capital gains,” which equals our realized capital gains on a
cumulative basis from May&nbsp;31,2010 through the end of the
fiscal year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses
and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the
aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee.
Importantly, thecapital gains portion of the incentive fee is based
on realized gains and realized and unrealized losses from
May&nbsp;31, 2010. Therefore, realized and unrealized losses
incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when
calculatingthe capital gains portion of the incentive fee, and our
Manager will be entitled to 20.0% of incentive fee capital gains
that arise after May&nbsp;31, 2010. In addition, for the purpose of
the “incentive fee capital gains” calculations,the cost basis for
computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of
May&nbsp;31, 2010 will equal the fair value of such investments as
of such date.</p>

Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in leveraged
loans (both first and second lien term loans) issued by middle
marketcompanies. Investments in middle market companies are
generally less liquid than equivalent investments in companies with
larger capitalizations. These investments are sourced in both the
primary and secondary markets through a network ofrelationships
with commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies
and financial sponsors. The leveraged loans that we purchase are
generally used to finance buyouts, acquisitions, growth,
recapitalizations and other types oftransactions. Leveraged loans
are generally senior debt instruments that rank ahead of
subordinated debt which are invested by companies with below
investment grade or “junk” ratings or, if not rated, would be rated
below investment gradeor “junk” and, as a result, carry a higher
risk of default. Leveraged loans also have the benefit of security
interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank
ahead of, or be junior to, other security interests. For
adiscussion of the risks pertaining to our secured investments, see
Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Our investments may be risky, and
you could lose all or part of your investment.”</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
As part of our long-term strategy, we also purchase mezzanine debt
and make equity investments in middle market companies. Mezzanine
debt istypically unsecured and subordinated to senior debt of the
portfolio company. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors—If we make
unsecured debt investments, we may lack adequate protection in the
event our portfolio companies become distressedor insolvent and
will likely experience a lower recovery than more senior
debtholders in the event our portfolio companies default on their
indebtedness.”</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Substantially all of the debt investments held in our portfolio
hold a <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-investment</font> grade
rating byone or more rating agencies or, if not rated, would be
rated below investment grade if rated, which are often referred to
as “junk.” As of February&nbsp;28, 2018, 79.9% of our debt
portfolio at fair value consisted of debt securities forwhich
issuers were not required to make principal payments until the
maturity of such debt securities, which could result in a
substantial loss to us if such issuers are unable to refinance or
repay their debt at maturity. Such“interest-only” loans are
structured such that the borrower makes only interest payments
throughout the life of the loan and makes a large, “balloon payment”
 at the end of the loan term. The ability of a borrower to make
orrefinance a balloon payment</p>

may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial
condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, higher
interest rates, and collateral values. If the interest-only
loanborrower is unable to make or refinance a balloon payment, we
may experience greater losses than if the loan were structured as
amortizing. As of February&nbsp;28, 2018, 38.5% of our
interest-only loans provided for contractual PIK interest,
whichrepresents contractual interest added to a loan balance and
due at the end of such loan’s term, and 71.5% of such investments
elected to pay a portion of interest due in PIK. In addition, 78.5%
of our debt investments at February&nbsp;28, 2018,had variable
interest rates that reset periodically based on benchmarks such as
LIBOR and the prime rate. As a result, significant increases in
such benchmarks in the future may make it more difficult for these
borrowers to service their obligationsunder the debt investments
that we hold.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory
requirements. For instance, we haveto invest at least 70.0% of our
total assets in assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the
1940 Act, including securities of U.S. operating companies whose
securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (i.e.,
New York StockExchange (the “NYSE”), NYSE MKT and The NASDAQ Stock

market capitalizations of less than $250.0&nbsp;million, cash, cash

While our primaryfocus is to generate current income and capital
appreciation from our debt and equity investments in middle market
companies, we may invest up to 30.0% of the portfolio in
opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns
tostockholders. Such investments may include investments in
distressed debt, private equity, securities of public companies
that are not thinly traded and structured finance vehicles such as
collateralized loan obligation funds. Although we have nocurrent
intention to do so, to the extent we invest in private equity
funds, we will limit our investments in entities that are excluded
from the definition of “investment company” under
Section&nbsp;3(c)(1) or Section&nbsp;3(c)(7) of the1940 Act, which
includes private equity funds, to no more than 15% of its net

Our leveraged loan portfolio is comprised primarily of first lien
and second lien term loans. First lien term loans are secured by a
firstpriority perfected security interest on all or substantially
all of the assets of the borrower and typically include a first
priority pledge of the capital stock of the borrower. First lien
term loans hold a first priority with regard to right ofpayment.
Generally, first lien term loans offer floating rate interest
payments, have a stated maturity of five to seven years, and have a
fixed amortization schedule. First lien term loans generally have
restrictive financial and negativecovenants. Second lien term loans
are secured by a second priority perfected security interest on all
or substantially all of the assets of the borrower and typically
include a second priority pledge of the capital stock of the
borrower. Second lienterm loans hold a second priority with regard
to right of payment. Second lien term loans offer either floating
rate or fixed rate interest payments, generally have a stated
maturity of five to eight years, and may or may not have a
fixedamortization schedule. Second lien term loans that do not have
fixed amortization schedules require payment of the principal
amount of the loan upon the maturity date of the loan. Second lien
term loans have less restrictive financial and negativecovenants
than those that govern first lien term loans.</p>

Mezzanine debt usually ranks subordinate in priority of payment to
senior debt and is often unsecured. However, mezzanine debt ranks
senior tocommon and preferred equity in a borrowers’ capital

have fixed amortization schedules.</p>

In some cases, our debt investments may provide for a portion of
the interest payable to be <font STYLE=

On January&nbsp;22, 2008, GSC Group, Inc., as asset manager, with
Lehman Brothers raising thefinancing, entered into a collateral
management agreement with Saratoga CLO. Saratoga CLO was structured
with five tranches of debt, plus residual notes. Saratoga CLO’s
five tranches of debt was purchased by a wide variety of CLO debt
marketparticipants. In addition, we purchased for
$30.0&nbsp;million all of the outstanding subordinated notes of
Saratoga CLO.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Pursuant to itsterms, the investment period for Saratoga CLO ended
in January 2013, and certain restrictions in such terms prevented
portfolio reinvestment. As a result, the Company determined that it
was in its best interest to refinance Saratoga CLO given thefee
income it receives for managing Saratoga CLO. The Company did not
originate any of the loan assets included in the formation of
Saratoga CLO, nor has it done so since the subsequent refinancing
transaction. Moreover, the Company does not expectto originate any
of the loans in the Saratoga CLO portfolio prospectively. The
Company has from time to time <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">co-invested</font> in loans with the Saratoga
CLO. The Company currently has no co-investments between it and
Saratoga CLO.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
With respect to our advisory services to Saratoga CLO, andin
particular the underwriting standards used when determining which
investments qualify for inclusion in the Saratoga CLO, they are
substantially similar to the process employed in selecting the
Company’s investments. All of the credit metricsfor a Saratoga CLO
investment are reviewed and documented in the same manner as they
would be for an investment for the Company, with some minor
differences. For example, the Saratoga CLO investment process also
includes the Standard&nbsp;&amp;Poors and Moody’s review of the
loan investment and the assigned corporate ratings, in addition to
the Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poors recovery rate analysis, which
typically does not apply to a prospective investment of the
Company. Lastly, aSaratoga CLO investment also considers the likely
secondary liquidity of the loan in considering the investment,
whereas the Company’s investments are generally illiquid.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced in October 2013 and its
reinvestment period ended in October 2016. On November&nbsp;15,
2016, wecompleted the second refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. The
Saratoga CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its
reinvestment period to October 2018, and extended its legal
maturity date to October 2025. Following the refinancing, the
SaratogaCLO portfolio remained at the same size and with a similar
capital structure of approximately $300.0&nbsp;million in aggregate
principal amount of predominantly senior secured first lien term
loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, wealso purchased
$4.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of the Class&nbsp;F
notes tranche of the Saratoga CLO at par, with a coupon of LIBOR
plus 8.5%. The Class&nbsp;F tranche is the eighth tranche in the
capital structure of Saratoga CLOand is subordinated to the other
debt classes of Saratoga CLO. The Class&nbsp;F tranche is only
senior to the subordinated notes, which is effectively the equity
position in Saratoga CLO. As a result, the other tranches of debt
in Saratoga CLO rankahead of the $4.5&nbsp;million Class&nbsp;F
tranche and ahead of the aggregate principal amount of our position
in the subordinated notes, which as of February&nbsp;28, 2018 had a
fair value of $11.9&nbsp;million, with respect to priority
ofpayments in the event of a default or a liquidation. After the
reinvestment period ends in October 2018, the Company will consider
refinancing the Saratoga CLO, subject to market conditions. A
refinancing transaction entails finding existing and newinvestors
that are willing to provide debt financing to Saratoga CLO on terms
that are acceptable to it and in an amount sufficient to allow it
to repay all of its existing debt holders. If Saratoga CLO is
unable to refinance its indebtedness byOctober 2018, then Saratoga
CLO will be required to use investment repayments by portfolio
companies received thereafter to repay its outstanding indebtedness
and ultimately liquidate Saratoga CLO.</p>

The terms of the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO entitles the
Company to the residual net interest income in Saratoga CLO, which
are paidon a quarterly basis after payment of all expenses,
assuming that the Saratoga CLO remains in compliance with its
various debt and rating agency compliance tests. The Company’s
investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO can be sold
ortransferred at any time. The Company has held 100% of the
subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO since the inception of Saratoga
CLO.</p>

"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Generally, the interests of the holders of the various classes of
securities issued by the Saratoga CLO are aligned with the
interests of theCompany as holder of the subordinated notes. The
investors in the various debt tranches of the securities issued by
the Saratoga CLO are interested in the regular payment of interest
income from the Saratoga CLO and the overcollateralization of
theunderlying loan assets relative to the Saratoga CLO debt issued.
On the other hand, the subordinated note holders might prefer
purchasing higher yielding riskier assets that could increase
returns while the returns of the holders of the debtsecurities
remain unchanged.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
With respect to the collateral management agreement that the
Company has entered into with Saratoga CLO,while the agreement is
similar to the investment advisory and management agreement between
the Company and Saratoga Investment Advisors in that it is an asset
management agreement, there are material differences between the
two. For example,pursuant to Section&nbsp;15 of the 1940 Act, the
Management Agreement with Saratoga Investment Advisors has an
initial term of two years, with annual renewals to be approved by
the Company’s board of directors. The contract can be terminated
bythe Company’s board of directors or stockholders with 60 days’
notice, with no penalty for termination. The collateral management
agreement that the Company has entered into with Saratoga CLO, on
the other hand, has no renewal requirement,and can be terminated
without cause with the approval of <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">two-thirds</font> of each of the class of CLO
securities, excluding votes from interested noteholders.
Furthermore, the Saratoga CLO collateral managementagreement cannot
be terminated with cause without the approval of a majority of all
of the CLO security holders voting collectively, excluding</p>

votes from interested noteholders. If the Saratoga CLO collateral
management agreement is terminated, the manager remains in place
until a new manager is appointed by the issuer at the directionof a
majority of the noteholders, and so long as such replacement is not
rejected within 20 days by the most senior class of the Saratoga
CLO securities. We receive a base management fee of 0.10% and a
subordinated management fee of 0.40% of theoutstanding principal
amount of Saratoga CLO’s assets, paid quarterly to the extent of
available proceeds. Prior to the second refinancing and the
issuance of the <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2013-1</font>
Amended CLO Notes, we received abase management fee of 0.25% and a
subordinated management fee of 0.25% of the outstanding principal
amount of Saratoga CLO’s assets, paid quarterly to the extent of
available proceeds. We are also entitled to an incentive management
fee equalto 20.0% of excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga
CLO subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in
cash equal to or greater than 12.0%.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The securities issued by the Saratoga CLO do not have any external
credit enhancement features that would minimize the potential
losses to thesubordinated notes. Saratoga CLO recognized losses of
approximately $3.4&nbsp;million in October 2013 and
$6.1&nbsp;million in November 2016 upon the refinancing as a result
of the legal and accounting costs associated with the refinancing
and thedivestiture of certain Saratoga CLO loans not eligible for
the refinanced Saratoga CLO. The cost of the refinancing was
effectively borne by the Company as the holder of the subordinated
notes in Saratoga CLO. The indenture for the Saratoga CLO doesnot
contemplate the issuance of additional securities while the
existing Saratoga CLO securities remain outstanding. The indenture
could be amended to allow the issuance of additional securities,
which would require consents of the holders of theSaratoga CLO debt
securities and the approval of the rating agencies. The Saratoga
CLO could issue additional securities pursuant to a refinancing of
the existing securities. The costs of any such future refinancing
would effectively be borne by usas the holder of the subordinated
notes in Saratoga CLO.</p>

The Company does not believe that any representations or warranties
made by theCompany as manager of Saratoga CLO or investor in the
subordinated notes could materially affect the Company. However,
because the Company acts as the collateral manager to Saratoga CLO,
it may be subject to claims by third-party investors inSaratoga CLO

of fiduciary duties committed in the scope of performing its

additional shares of our commonstock pursuant to our dividend

dividends to our stockholders. However, in January 2009, we
suspended the practice of paying quarterly dividends to our
stockholders and thereafter paid fiveannual dividend distributions
(December 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009) to our stockholders

On September&nbsp;24, 2014, we announced the recommencement of

dividend distributions on behalf of our stockholders unless a
stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result,if our board of
directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our
stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP by the dividend
record date will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested
into additional shares ofour common stock, rather than receiving
the cash dividends. We have the option to satisfy the share
requirements of the DRIP through the issuance of new shares of

We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or
shares of ourcommon stock at the election of each stockholder.
Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury
regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at
the election of stockholders are treated as taxable dividends.
TheInternal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has issued private rulings
indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of
cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20.0% of
the total distribution. Under these rulings,if too many
stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, each
such stockholder would receive a pro rata share of the total cash
to be distributed and would receive the remainder of their
distribution in shares of stock. If we decide tomake any
distributions consistent with these rulings that are payable in
part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends
will be required to include the full amount of the dividend
(whether received in cash, our stock, or acombination thereof) as
ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such
distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to
the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for
United States federal incometax purposes. As a result, a U.S.
stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such
dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder
sells the stock he or she receives as a dividend in order to pay
this tax, the salesproceeds may be less than the amount included in
income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price
of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> stockholders,
wemay be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such
dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such
dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant
number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stockin
order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure
on the trading price of our stock.</p>

<b>Competition</b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Our primary competitors in providing financing to private middle
market companies include public and private investment funds
(includingprivate equity funds, mezzanine funds, BDCs and SBICs),
commercial and investment banks and commercial financing companies.
Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds,
frequently invest in middle-market companies. As aresult,
competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies
can be intense, and in the past couple of years we believe there
has been an increase in the amount of debt capital available on
average. This has resulted in a somewhatmore competitive
environment for making new investments. Many middle-market
companies are still unable to raise senior debt financing through
traditional large financial institutions, and we believe this
approach to financing remains difficult asimplementation of U.S.
and international financial reforms, such as Basel 3, limits the
capacity of large financial institutions to hold <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">non-investment</font> grade leveraged loans on
their balance sheets. We believethat many of these financial
institutions have <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">de-emphasized</font> their service and product
offerings to middle-market companies in particular.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have
considerably greater financial and marketing resources than us. For
example, somecompetitors may have access to funding sources that
are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may
have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which
may allow them to consider a wider variety of investments
andestablish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our
competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the
1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or that the Code imposes on us as a
RIC. We use the industry information available tothe investment
professionals of Saratoga Investment Advisors to assess investment
risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in
portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the investment
professionals of our Investment Adviserenable us to learn about,
and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with
attractive leveraged companies in the industries in which we seek
to invest.</p>

Pursuant to the Management Agreement with Saratoga Investment
Advisors, we pay Saratoga Investment Advisors a fee for investment
advisory andmanagement services consisting of two components—a base
management fee and an incentive fee.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The base management fee is paidquarterly in arrears, and equals
1.75% per annum of our gross assets (other than cash or cash
equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) and
calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter based on the average
value of our grossassets (other than cash or cash equivalents but
including assets purchased with borrowed funds) as of the end of
such fiscal quarter and the end of the immediate prior fiscal
quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter
areappropriately <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">pro-rated.</font></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The incentive fee has the following two parts:</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based
on our <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee
netinvestment income for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter.
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Pre-incentive</font> fee net
investment income means interest income, dividend income and any
other income (including any other fees such as
commitment,origination, structuring, diligence, managerial and
consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio
companies) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating
expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee,
expensespayable under the Administration Agreement, and any
interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding
preferred stock or debt security, but excluding the incentive fee).
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Pre-incentive</font> fee
netinvestment income includes, in the case of investments with a
deferred interest feature (such as market discount, debt
instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends
and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not
yetreceived in cash. <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">Pre-incentive</font> fee net investment income
does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital
losses, unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation or realized
gains or lossesresulting from the extinguishment of our own debt.
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Pre-incentive</font> fee net
investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of
our net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities) at the
end ofthe immediately preceding fiscal quarter, is compared to a 
“hurdle rate” of 1.875% per quarter, subject to a “catch up”
provision. The base management fee is calculated prior to giving
effect to the payment of any incentive fees.</p>

The second part of the incentive fee, the capital gains fee, is
determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscalyear
(or, upon termination of the Management Agreement), and is
calculated at the end of each applicable fiscal year by subtracting
(1)&nbsp;the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital
losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciationfrom
(2)&nbsp;our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each
case calculated from May&nbsp;31, 2010. If such amount is positive
at the end of such year, then the capital gains fee for such year
is equal to 20.0% of such amount, less thecumulative aggregate
amount of capital gains fees paid in all prior years. If such
amount is negative, then there is no capital gains fee for such
year.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Under the Management Agreement, the capital gains portion of the
incentive fee is based on realized gains and realized andunrealized
losses from May&nbsp;31, 2010. Therefore, realized and unrealized
losses incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account
when calculating the capital gains portion of the incentive fee,
and Saratoga Investment Advisors will beentitled to 20.0% of net
capital gains that arise after May&nbsp;31, 2010. In addition, the
cost basis for computing our realized gains and losses on
investments held by us as of May&nbsp;31, 2010 equals the fair
value of such investments as of suchdate.</p>

Pursuant to a separate Administration Agreement, Saratoga

furnishes us with officefacilities, equipment and clerical,
book-keeping and record keeping services. Under the Administration
Agreement, our administrator also performs, or oversees the
performance of, our required administrative services, which
include, among otherthings, being responsible for the financial
records which we are required to maintain, preparing reports for
our stockholders and reports required to be filed with the SEC. In
addition, our administrator assists us in determining and
publishing ournet asset value, oversees the preparation and filing
of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to
our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our
expenses and the performance of administrative and
professionalservices rendered to us by others. Payments under the
Administration Agreement equal an amount based upon our allocable
portion of our administrator’s overhead in performing its
obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent
andour allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their
respective staffs relating to the performance of services under
this agreement (including travel expenses). Our allocable portion
is based on the proportion that our total assets bears tothe total
assets administered or managed by our administrator. Under the
Administration Agreement, our administrator also provides
managerial assistance, on our behalf, to those portfolio companies
who accept our offer of assistance. TheAdministration Agreement may
be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written
notice to the other party. Our board of directors, including a
majority of independent directors, will annually review the
compensation we pay to theAdviser to determine that the provisions
of the Administrative Agreement are carried out satisfactorily and
to determine, among other things, whether the fees payable under
such agreement are reasonable in light of the services provided.
Our boardof directors reviews the methodology employed in
determining how the expenses are allocated to us and any proposed
allocation of administrative expenses among us and any affiliates
of the Adviser. Our board of directors then assesses
thereasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to
us based on the breadth, depth and quality of the administrative
services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining
similar services from third-party service providers knownto be
available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether
any single third-party service provider would be capable of
providing all such services at comparable cost and quality.
Finally, our board of directors compares the total amountpaid to
the Adviser for such services as a percentage of our net assets to
the same ratio as reported by other comparable funds. The amount
payable by us under the Administration Agreement was initially
capped at $1.0&nbsp;million for each annualterm of the agreement.

We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As with
other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to
certainsubstantive regulatory requirements. The 1940 Act contains
prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs
and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-advisers),</font>principal
underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters,
and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than
“interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In
addition, the 1940 Actprovides that we may not change the nature of
our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as,
a BDC, unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting
securities,” as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of
theoutstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the

registered money market funds, we generally cannotacquire more than
3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than
5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one
investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our
total assets in the securities of morethan one investment company.
With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities
issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such

expenses.</p>

securities maturing in one year or less from the time of

assets.Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in
repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully
collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government
or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase byan
investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous
agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future
date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an
amount that reflects an agreed-upon interestrate. There is no
percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be
invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25.0%
of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single
counterparty, we would notmeet the asset diversification
requirements in order to qualify as a regulated investment company

will use the following guidelines:</p>
<p STYLE=

<i>Elections of Directors:</i> In general, Saratoga Investment
Advisors will vote in favor of the management-proposed slate of
directors. Ifthere is a proxy fight for seats on a portfolio
company’s board of directors, or Saratoga Investment Advisors
determines that there are other compelling reasons for withholding
our vote, it will determine the appropriate vote on the matter.
Itmay withhold votes for directors that fail to act on key issues,
such as failure to: (1)&nbsp;implement proposals to declassify a
board, (2)&nbsp;implement a majority vote requirement,
(3)&nbsp;submit a rights plan to a stockholder vote or(4)&nbsp;act

statement.</p>

cast our votes in accordance with the management on such proposals.
However, Saratoga Investment Advisors will consider carefully any
proposal regarding a change in corporate structure thatis not
required by state or federal regulation.</p>

extension of the investment decision. Accordingly, Saratoga

<i>Proposals Affecting Stockholder Rights:</i> We will generally
vote infavor of proposals that give stockholders a greater voice in
the affairs of a portfolio company and oppose any measure that
seeks to limit such rights. However, when analyzing such proposals,
Saratoga Investment Advisors will balance the financialimpact of
the proposal against any impairment of stockholder rights as well
as of our investment in the portfolio company.</p>

subjectto the satisfaction of certain customary procedures.
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">SBA-guaranteed</font> debentures
are <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-recourse,</font> interest
only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have aten
year maturity. The principal amount of <font STYLE=

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital
to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make
loansto eligible small businesses and invest in the equity
securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations,
eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible
net worth not exceeding $19.5&nbsp;million and have average
annualfully taxed net income not exceeding $6.5&nbsp;million for
the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote
25.0% of its investment activity to “smaller” concerns as defined
by the SBA. A smaller concern is one that has atangible net worth
not exceeding $6.0&nbsp;million and has average annual fully taxed
net income not exceeding $2.0&nbsp;million for the two most recent
fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size
standard criteria to determineeligibility, which depend on the
industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such
factors as the number of employees and gross sales. According to
SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small
businesses, invest in theequity securities of such businesses and
provide them with consulting and advisory services.</p>

principal risk factors associated with investment in the Company
specifically, as well as those factors generally associated
withinvestment in a company with investment objectives, investment
policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to the

<b>Risks Related to Our Business and Structure</b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
<b><i>Marketvolatility and the condition of the debt and equity
capital markets could negatively impact our financial condition and
stock price.</i></b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
From time to time, capital markets may experience periods of
disruption and instability. For example, between 2008 and 2009, the
global capitalmarkets were unstable as evidenced by periodic
disruptions in liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant
write-offs in the financial services sector, the <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">re-pricing</font> of credit risk in the
broadlysyndicated credit market and the failure of major financial
institutions. Despite actions of the U.S. federal government and
foreign governments, these events contributed to worsening general
economic conditions that materially and adverselyimpacted the
broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability
of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial
services firms in particular. While market conditions have largely
recovered from the events of 2008and 2009, there have been
continuing periods of volatility, some lasting longer than others.
For example, the referendum by British voters to exit the European
Union in June 2016 led to further disruption and instability in the
global markets. Therecan be no assurance these market conditions
will not repeat themselves or worsen in the future.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Equity capital may be difficult to raiseduring periods of adverse
or volatile market conditions because, subject to some limited
exceptions, as a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional
shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value
without first obtainingapproval for such issuance from our
stockholders and our independent directors.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Volatility and dislocation in the capital markets canalso create a
challenging environment in which to raise or access debt capital.
The reappearance of market conditions similar to those experienced
from 2008 through 2009 for any substantial length of time could
make it difficult to extend thematurity of or refinance our
existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms
and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on
our business. The debt capital that will be available to us in the
future, if at all,may be at a higher cost and on less favorable
terms and conditions than what we currently experience including
being at a higher cost due to a rising rate environment. If we are
unable to raise or refinance debt, then our equity investors may
notbenefit from the potential for increased returns on equity
resulting from leverage and we may be limited in our ability to
make new commitments or to fund existing commitments to our
portfolio companies.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also
have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments. While
most ofour investments are not publicly traded, applicable
accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation
process that our investments are sold in a principal market to
market participants (even if we plan on holding an
investmentthrough its maturity). Significant changes in the capital
markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the
potential for liquidity events involving our investments. Thus, the
illiquidity of our investments may make it difficultfor us to sell
such investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we
could realize significantly less than the value at which we have
recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for
liquidity purposes. An inability toraise or access capital could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
As a resultof the 2016 U.S. election, the Republican Party
currently controls both the executive and legislative branches of
government, which increases the likelihood that legislation may be
adopted that could significantly affect the regulation of
U.S.financial markets. Areas subject to potential change, amendment
or repeal include the Dodd-Frank Act and the authority of the
Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The
United States may also potentially withdraw from orrenegotiate
various trade agreements and take other actions that would change
current trade policies of the United States. We cannot predict
which, if any, of these actions will be taken or, if taken, their
effect on the financial stability of theUnited States. Such actions
could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the effects
of these or similar events in the future on the U.S. economy and
securities markets oron our investments. We monitor developments
and seek to manage our investments in a manner consistent with
achieving our investment objective, but there can be no assurance
that we will be successful in doing so.</p>

The incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser may
create an incentivefor it to make investments on our behalf that
are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence
of such compensation arrangement, which could result in higher
investment losses, particularly during cyclical economic downturns.
Theway in which the incentive fee payable to our Investment Adviser
is determined, which is calculated separately in two components as
a percentage of the income (subject to a hurdle rate) and as a
percentage of the realized gain on invested capital,may encourage
our Investment Adviser to use leverage to increase the return on
our investments or otherwise manipulate our income so as to
recognize income in quarters where the hurdle rate is exceeded.
Moreover, we pay Saratoga Investment Advisorsa base management fee
based on our total assets, including any investments made with
borrowings, which may create an incentive for it to cause us to
incur more leverage than is prudent, or not to repay our
outstanding indebtedness when it may beadvantageous for us to do
so, in order to maximize its compensation. Under certain
circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of
default, which would disfavor the holders of our securities.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The incentive fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser also may
create an incentive for our Investment Adviser to invest on our
behalf ininstruments that have a deferred interest feature. Under
these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of
the investment but would not receive the cash income from the
investment until the end of the investment’s term, if atall. Our
net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our
incentive fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion
of the incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet
received in cash and may never receivein cash if the portfolio
company is unable to satisfy such interest payment obligation to
us. Consequently, while we may make incentive fee payments on
income accruals that we may not collect in the future and with
respect to which we do not have a“claw back” right against our
Investment Adviser per se, the amount of accrued income written off
in any period will reduce the income in the period in which such
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">write-off</font> was taken and may
therebyreduce such period’s incentive fee payment.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
In addition, Saratoga Investment Advisors receives a quarterly
income incentive feebased, in part, on our <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee net investment
income, if any, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
This income incentive fee is subject to a fixed quarterly hurdle
rate before providing anincome incentive fee return to Saratoga
Investment Advisors. This fixed hurdle rate was determined when
then current interest rates were relatively low on a historical
basis. Thus, if interest rates rise, it would become easier for our
investmentincome to exceed the hurdle rate and, as a result, more
likely that Saratoga Investment Advisors will receive an income
incentive fee than if interest rates on our investments remained
constant or decreased. However, if we repurchase our
outstandingdebt securities, including our 6.75% Notes due 2023 (the
“2023 Notes”) and such repurchase results in our recording a net
gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt for financial reporting
and tax purposes, such net gain or loss will notbe included in our
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee net
investment income for purposes of determining the income incentive
fee payable to our Investment Adviser under the Management
Agreement.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Moreover, our Investment Adviser receives the incentive fee based,
in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike
theportion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no
performance threshold applicable to the portion of the incentive
fee based on net capital gains. As a result, our Investment Adviser
may have a tendency to invest more in investments that arelikely to
result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities.
Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative
securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in
higher investment losses, particularlyduring economic
downturns.</p>

dollarclaims on our assets that are superior to the claims of the
holders of our securities. Leverage is generally considered a
speculative investment technique. Any increase in our income in
excess of interest payable on our outstanding indebtednesswould
cause our net income to increase more than it would have had we not
incurred leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net
income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not
incurred leverage. Such a decline couldnegatively affect our
ability to make common stock distributions or scheduled debt

General interest rate fluctuations and changes in credit spreads on
floating rate loans may have a substantial negative impact onour

a material adverse effect on our rate of return on invested
capital. In addition, an increase in interest rates would make it
more expensive to use debt to finance ourinvestments. Decreases in
credit spreads on debt that pays a floating rate of return would
have an impact on the income generation of our floating rate
assets. Trading prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return
tend to fall as interest ratesrise. Trading prices tend to
fluctuate more for fixed rate securities that have longer
maturities. Although we have no policy governing the maturities of
our investments, under current market conditions we expect that we

have floating interest rates. As a result, asignificant change in
market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our
net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our
cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment
income. We may hedge againstsuch interest rate fluctuations by
using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and
forward contracts, subject to applicable legal requirements,
including without limitation, all necessary registrations (or
exemptions fromregistration) with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. These activities may limit our ability to participate
in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged

LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of

interbankmarket and is widely used as a reference for setting the
interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a
reference rate in floating-rate loans we extend to portfolio

On July&nbsp;27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct
Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to
phase outLIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time
whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating
LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after
2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with theAlternative
Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large
U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar
LIBOR with a new index calculated by short term repurchase
agreements, backed by Treasury securities.The future of LIBOR at
this time is uncertain. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to
renegotiate the credit agreements extending beyond 2021 with our
portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining

ability to raise additional capital.</i></b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Our business requires a substantial amount of additional capital.
We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of senior
securities orother indebtedness or the issuance of additional
shares of our common stock. However, we may not be able to raise
additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. We
may issue debt securities or preferred securities, which we refer
tocollectively as “senior securities,” and we may borrow money from
banks or other financial institutions, up to the maximum amount
permitted by the 1940 Act.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Currently, we are generally permitted to incur indebtedness or
issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage, as
defined inthe 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of
senior securities; however, as discussed under “Recent legislation
may allow us to incur additional leverage” below, we may be
permitted to increase our leverage if we receivecertain approvals
from our independent directors and/or our stockholders. Compliance
with these requirements may unfavorably limit our investment
opportunities and reduce our ability in comparison to other
companies to profit from favorable spreadsbetween the rates at
which we can borrow and the rates at which we can lend. As a
business development company, therefore, we may need to issue
equity more frequently than our privately owned competitors, which
may lead to greater stockholderdilution. With respect to stock that
is a senior security, we must make provisions to prohibit any
dividend distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of
certain of our securities, unless we meet the applicable asset
coverage ratios at thetime of the dividend distribution or
repurchase. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable
to satisfy the asset coverage test. If that happens, we may be
required to liquidate a portion of our investments and repay a
portion of ourindebtedness at a time when such sales may be
disadvantageous in order to make dividend distributions or
repurchase certain of our securities.</p>

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a
price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our
commonstock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common
stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common
stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our
best interests and the best interests of ourstockholders, and our
stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at
which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than
a price which, in the determination of our board of directors,
closely approximates the marketvalue of such securities (less any
commission or discount). If our common stock trades at a discount
to net asset value, this restriction could adversely affect our
ability to raise capital. We do not currently have stockholder
approval of issuancesbelow net asset value.</p>

<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The 1940 Act generally prohibits us from incurring indebtedness
unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage
for totalborrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may
not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). However, the Small
Business Credit Availability Act, which was signed into law on
March&nbsp;23, 2018, has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDCto
increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset
coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if
certain requirements are met. Under the legislation, we are allowed
to increase our leverage capacity if shareholdersrepresenting at
least a majority of the votes cast, when quorum is met, approve a
proposal to do so. If we receive shareholder approval, we would be
allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after
such approval. Alternatively, thelegislation allows the majority of
our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage
capacity, and such approval would become effective after one year.
In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on
our websiteand in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the
receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity
and usage, and risks related to leverage.</p>

As a result of this legislation, we may be able to increase our
leverage up to an amount that reduces our asset coverage ratio from
200% to150%. Leverage magnifies the potential for loss on
investments in our indebtedness and on invested equity capital. As
we use leverage to partially finance our investments, you will
experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If
thevalue of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the
net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more
sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the

income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds
wouldcause our net investment income to increase more than it would
without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause
net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have
had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negativelyaffect our
ability to pay common stock dividends, scheduled debt payments or
other payments related to our securities. Leverage is generally
considered a speculative investment technique. See “Risk Factors—

First loss positions typically carry a higher risk and earn a

heavilyinvested suffers from adverse business or economic
conditions, a material portion of our investment in Saratoga CLO
could be affected adversely, which, in turn, could adversely affect
our financial position and results of operations. For example, asof
February&nbsp;28, 2018, Saratoga CLO’s investments in the business
services industry represented approximately 15.4% of the fair value
of Saratoga CLO’s portfolio. Companies in the business services
industry are subject to generaleconomic downturns and business
cycles, and will often suffer reduced revenues and rate pressures
during periods of economic uncertainty. In addition, investments in
the healthcare&nbsp;&amp; pharmaceuticals industry represented
approximately 8.3%of the fair value of Saratoga CLO’s portfolio.
Changes in healthcare or other laws and regulations applicable to
the businesses of some of the companies in which Saratoga CLO
invests may occur that could increase their compliance and
othercosts of doing business, require significant systems
enhancements, or render their products or services less profitable
or obsolete, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
their results of operations. There has also been an
increasedpolitical and regulatory focus on healthcare laws in
recent years, and new legislation could have a material effect on
the business and operations of companies in which Saratoga CLO
invests.</p>

Although there are limitations on our ability to invest in foreign

include changes in exchange controlregulations, political and
social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes,
less liquid markets and less available information than is
generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs,
less government supervision ofexchanges, brokers and issuers, less
developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual
obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and
greater price volatility.</p>
<p STYLE=

Investments in the debt of emerging market issuers may subject us
to additional risks such as inflation, wage and price controls, and
theimposition of trade barriers. Furthermore, economic conditions
in emerging market countries are, to some extent, influenced by
economic and securities market conditions in other emerging market
countries. Although economic conditions are differentin each
country, investors’ reaction to developments in one country can
have effects on the debt of issuers in other countries.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Although most of our investments will be U.S. dollar-denominated,
our investments that are denominated in a foreign currency will be
subjectto the risk that the value of a particular currency will
change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the
factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the
level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative
valuesof similar assets in different currencies, long-term
opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and
political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to
minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that we will fully
hedgeagainst these risks or that such strategies will be effective.
As a result, a change in currency exchange rates may adversely
affect our profitability.</p>

transactions.</i></b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency
options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek
to hedgeagainst fluctuations in the relative values of our
portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and
market interest rates. Use of these hedging instruments may expose
us to counter-party credit risk. Hedging against a decline in
thevalues of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the
possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or
prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However,
such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain
fromthose same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the
value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may
also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the portfolio
positions should increase. Moreover, it may not bepossible to hedge
against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is
generally anticipated at an acceptable price.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The successof our hedging transactions will depend on our ability

Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to
reduce currency exchange rate andinterest rate risks, unanticipated
changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in
poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in
any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of
correlation betweenprice movements of the instruments used in a
hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions
being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may
not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such
hedginginstruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any
such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the
intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may
not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against
currencyfluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated
in <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font> currencies
because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a
result of factors not entirely related to currencyfluctuations. To
the extent we engage in hedging transactions, we also face the risk
that counterparties to the derivative instruments we hold may
default, which may expose us to unexpected losses from positions
where we believed that our risk hadbeen appropriately hedged.</p>

We have in the past, and may continue to, distribute taxable
dividends that are payable to ourstockholders in part through the
issuance of shares of our common stock. For example, on
October&nbsp;30, 2013, our board of directors declared a dividend
of $2.65 per share to shareholders payable in cash or shares of our
common stock. Undercertain applicable provisions of the Code and
the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in
shares of stock at the election of stockholders are treated as
taxable dividends. The IRS has issued private rulings indicating
that thisrule will apply even where the total amount of cash that
may be distributed is limited to no more than 20.0% of the total
distribution. Under these rulings, if too many stockholders elect
to receive their distributions in cash, each such stockholderwould
receive a pro rata share of the total cash to be distributed and
would receive the remainder of their distribution in shares of
stock. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with these
rulings that are payable in part in our stock,taxable stockholders
receiving such dividends will be required to include the full
amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, our stock, or a
combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital
gain to the extent suchdistribution is properly reported as a
capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated
earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes.
As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with
respect tosuch dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S.
stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to
pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount
included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on
themarket price of our stock at the time of the sale.</p>

Furthermore, with respect to <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</font>stockholders, we may be
required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends,
including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is
payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our
stockholders determine to sellshares of our stock in order to pay
taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the
trading price of our stock.</p>

OnSeptember&nbsp;24, 2014, we announced the recommencement of
quarterly dividends to our stockholders. We have adopted a DRIP
that provides for reinvestment of our dividend distributions on
behalf of our stockholders unless a stockholder elects toreceive
cash. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we
declare, a cash dividend, then our stockholders who have not “opted
out” of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their cash
dividends automaticallyreinvested into additional shares of our
common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends. We have the
option to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP through the
issuance of new shares of common stock or through open market

The 2023 Notes are obligations exclusively of Saratoga Investment
Corp., and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of oursubsidiaries
is a guarantor of the 2023 Notes and the 2023 Notes are not
required to be guaranteed by any subsidiary we may acquire or
create in the future, including indebtedness under the Credit
Facility. Any assets of our subsidiaries are notdirectly available
to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the
2023 Notes. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized
claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors of our
subsidiaries will have priorityover our equity interests in such
entities (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including
holders of the 2023 Notes) with respect to the assets of such
entities. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of
these entities, ourclaims would still be effectively subordinated
to any security interests in the assets of any such entity and to
any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such entity senior to
our claims. Consequently, the 2023 Notes are
structurallysubordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities
of any of our subsidiaries and portfolio companies with respect to
which we hold equity investments. In addition, our subsidiaries and
these entities may incur substantial indebtedness in thefuture, all
of which would be structurally senior to the 2023 Notes. As of
February&nbsp;28, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under
the Credit Facility and we had the ability to borrow up to
$45.0&nbsp;million under the Credit Facility,subject to certain
conditions. As of February&nbsp;28, 2018, we had
$137.7&nbsp;million in <font STYLE=

The indebtedness under the Credit Facility and to SBA-guaranteed

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness,

lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such

sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds
necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any,
and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply
withthe various covenants, including financial and operating
covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could
be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such
indebtedness, including the 2023 Notes. In the event of
suchdefault, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to
declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lender under the
Credit Facility or other debt we may incur in the future couldelect
to terminate its commitment, cease making further loans and
institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could
be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, any such
default may constitute a default under the 2023Notes, which could
further limit our ability to repay our debt, including the 2023
Notes. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future
need to seek to obtain waivers from the lender under the Credit
Facility or other debt that we mayincur in the future to avoid
being in default. If we breach our covenants under the Credit
Facility or other debt and seek a waiver, we may not be able to
obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would
be in default under theCredit Facility or other debt, the lender
could exercise its rights as described above, and we could be

Our distributions, if any, will be determined by our board of
directors and paid out of assets legally available for
distribution. Any suchdistributions generally will be taxable to
our stockholders, including to those stockholders who receive
additional shares of our common stock pursuant to our dividend
reinvestment plan. Prior to January 2009, we paid quarterly
dividends to ourstockholders. However, in January 2009, we
suspended the practice of paying quarterly dividends to our
stockholders and thereafter, paid five annual dividend
distributions (December 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009) to our
stockholders since suchtime, which distributions were made with a
combination of cash and the issuance of shares of our common stock
as discussed more fully below.</p>
<p STYLE=

On September&nbsp;24, 2014, we announced the recommencement of
quarterly dividends to our stockholders. We have adopted a
dividendreinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that provides for reinvestment
of our dividend distributions on behalf of our stockholders unless
a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our board of
directors authorizes, and we declare, a cashdividend, then our
stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP by the dividend
record date will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested
into additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving
the cash dividends.We have the option to satisfy the share
requirements of the DRIP through the issuance of new shares of
common stock or through open market purchases of common stock by
the DRIP plan administrator.</p>

We are prohibited from making distributions that cause us to fail

covenants.</p>

In order to maintain tax treatment as a RIC, we must for each
fiscal yeardistribute an amount equal to at least 90.0% of our
ordinary net taxable income and realized net short-term capital
gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any,
reduced by deductible expenses. In addition, we will be subject
tofederal excise taxes to the extent we do not distribute during
the calendar year at least (1) 98.0% of our ordinary income for the
calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital
losses for the one year period ending onOctober&nbsp;31 of the
calendar year and (3)&nbsp;any ordinary income and net capital
gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such
years and on which we paid no federal income tax. For the 2017
calendar year, the Company madedistributions sufficient such that
we did not incur any federal excise taxes. For the 2014, 2015 and
2016 calendar years, our distributions were insufficient such that
we incurred federal excise taxes. We may elect to withhold from
distribution aportion of our ordinary income for the 2016 calendar
year and/or portion of the capital gains in excess of capital
losses realized during the one year period ending October 31, 2016,
if any, and, if we do so, we would expect to incur federal
excisetaxes as a result.</p>

Pursuant to a revenue procedure (Revenue Procedure <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">2010-12),</font> or the RevenueProcedure,
issued by the IRS, the IRS indicated that it would treat
distributions from certain publicly traded RICs (including BDCs)
that were paid part in cash and part in stock as dividends that
would satisfy the RIC’s annual distributionrequirements and qualify
for the dividends paid deduction for federal income tax purposes.
In order to qualify for such treatment, the Revenue Procedure
required that at least 10.0% of the total distribution be payable
in cash and that eachstockholder have a right to elect to receive
its entire distribution in cash. If too many stockholders elected
to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must
receive a proportionate share of the cash to be distributed
(although nostockholder electing to receive cash may receive less
than 10.0% of such stockholder’s distribution in cash). This
Revenue Procedure applied to distributions declared on or before
December&nbsp;31, 2012 with respect to taxable years ending onor
before December&nbsp;31, 2011.</p>

Although this Revenue Procedure is no longer available and did not
apply to our distributions forour fiscal year ended February 28,
2018, the revenue procedure was based upon certain applicable
provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations pursuant to
which distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the
election ofstockholders are treated as taxable dividends.
Consistent with these provisions, the IRS has issued private letter
rulings concluding that a RIC may treat a distribution of its own
stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if
eachstockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution
in either cash or stock of the RIC subject to a limitation on the
aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders,
which limitation must be at least 20.0% of theaggregate declared
distribution.</p>

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a
BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the“1940Act”). Our
investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser
extent, capital appreciation from our investments. We invest
primarily in leveraged loans and mezzanine debt issued by private
U.S. middle market companies, which wedefine as companies having
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (
“EBITDA”) of between $2&nbsp;million and $50&nbsp;million, both
through direct lending and through participation in loan
syndicates. We may alsoinvest up to 30.0% of the portfolio in
opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to
stockholders. Such investments may include investments in
distressed debt, which may include securities of companies in
bankruptcy, foreign debt,private equity, securities of public
companies that are not thinly traded and structured finance
vehicles such as collateralized loan obligation funds. Although we
have no current intention to do so, to the extent we invest in
private equity funds,we will limit our investments in entities that
are excluded from the definition of “investment company” under
Section&nbsp;3(c)(1) or Section&nbsp;3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, which
includes private equity funds, to no more than 15.0% of itsnet
assets. We have elected and qualified to be treated as a RIC under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
“Code”).</p>

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles(“U.S. GAAP”) requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting
amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial

recognition and therecognition of capital gains incentive fee
expense as our most critical accounting estimates. We continuously
evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters
described below. These estimates are based on the information that

that its investments are to be sold at the balance sheet date in

Specifically, we use Intex cash flow models, or an appropriate

projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment rate and
prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations. The

provided by third parties as well as managementestimates. We use
the output from the Intex models (i.e., the estimated cash flows)

We generate revenue in the form of interest income and capital
gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains,
ifany, on equity interests that we may acquire. We expect our debt
investments, whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine
debt, to have terms of up to ten years, and to bear interest at
either a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt willbe payable
generally either quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, our
debt or preferred equity investments may provide for a portion or
all of the interest to be PIK. To the extent interest is PIK, it
will be payable through the increase of theprincipal amount of the
obligation by the amount of interest due on the then-outstanding
aggregate principal amount of such obligation. The principal amount
of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally
become due at the maturitydate. In addition, we may generate
revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or
diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance or
investment management services and possibly consulting fees. Any
such fees will begenerated in connection with our investments and
recognized as earned. We may also invest in preferred equity or
common equity securities that pay dividends on a current basis.</p>

On January&nbsp;22, 2008, we entered into a collateral management
agreement with Saratoga CLO, pursuant to which we act as its
collateralmanager. The Saratoga CLO was initially refinanced in
October 2013 and its reinvestment period ended in October 2016. On
November&nbsp;15, 2016, we completed the second refinancing of the
Saratoga CLO. The Saratoga CLO refinancing, among otherthings,
extended its reinvestment period to October 2018, and extended its
legal maturity date to October 2025. Following the refinancing, the
Saratoga CLO portfolio remained at the same size and with a similar
capital structure of approximately$300.0&nbsp;million in aggregate
principal amount of predominantly senior secured first lien term
loans. In addition to refinancing its liabilities, we also
purchased $4.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of the
Class&nbsp;F notes trancheof the Saratoga CLO at par, with a coupon
of LIBOR plus 8.5%.</p>

The Saratoga CLO remains effectively 100% owned and managed by
SaratogaInvestment Corp. Following the refinancing, we receive a
base management fee of 0.10% and a subordinated management fee of
0.40% of the fee basis amount at the beginning of the collection
period, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds.We are
also entitled to an incentive management fee equal to 20.0% of
excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO subordinated notes
receive an internal rate of return paid in cash equal to or greater
than 12.0%.</p>

We recognize interest income on our investment in the subordinated

changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in
prepayments and/or<font STYLE=

In October 2016, the SEC adopted new rules and amended existing
rules (together, “final rules”) intended tomodernize the reporting

the amendments to Regulation <font STYLE=

Saratoga Investment Advisors normally grades all of our investments
using a credit and monitoring rating system (“CMR”). The
CMRconsists of a single component: a color rating. The color rating
is based on several criteria, including financial and operating
strength, probability of default, and restructuring risk. The color
ratings are characterized as follows:(Green)—performing credit;
(Yellow)—underperforming credit; (Red)—in principal payment default
and/or expected loss of principal.</p>

For the years ended February&nbsp;28, 2018 and February&nbsp;28,
2017, the increase in interest and debt financing expenses is
primarilyattributable to an increase in outstanding SBA debentures.
Our SBA debentures increased from $112.7&nbsp;million at
February&nbsp;28, 2017 to $137.7&nbsp;million at February&nbsp;28,
2018. For the year ended February&nbsp;28, 2018, the

4.50% compared to 4.76% for the fiscal year ended February&nbsp;28,
2017 and 4.92% for the fiscal year ended February&nbsp;29, 2016.
The decrease in the weighted average interest rate wasprimarily
driven by an increase in SBA debentures that carry a lower interest
rate as well as the notes payable interest rate decreasing from
7.50% to 6.75% following the refinancing of the 2020 Notes. SBA
debentures increased from 60.2% of overalldebt as of
February&nbsp;28, 2017 to 64.9% as of February&nbsp;28, 2018,

equity offerings, including our dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”
), and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings, to the
extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our
plansto raise capital will be successful. In this regard, because
our common stock has historically traded at a price below our
current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability
to sell our common stock at a price below net asset valueper share,
we have been and may continue to be limited in our ability to raise

In addition, we intend to distribute toour stockholders
substantially all of our taxable income in order to satisfy the
distribution requirement applicable to RICs under the Code. In
satisfying this distribution requirement, we have in the past
relied on Internal Revenue Service(“IRS”) issued private letter
rulings concluding that a RIC may treat a distribution of its own
stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each
stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in
either cash orstock of the RIC subject to a limitation on the
aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders,
which limitation must be at least 20.0% of the aggregate declared
distribution. We may rely on these IRS private letter rulings in

of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least
200.0%, or, if we obtain the required approvals from ourindependent
directors and/or stockholders, 150.0%. This requirement limits the

<p STYLE=

<i>Availability.</i> TheCompany can draw up to the lesser of (i)
$40.0&nbsp;million (the “Facility Amount”) and (ii)&nbsp;the
product of the applicable advance rate (which varies from 50.0% to
75.0% depending on the type of loan asset) and the value,
determinedin accordance with the Credit Facility (the “Adjusted
Borrowing Value”), of certain “eligible” loan assets pledged as
security for the loan (the “Borrowing Base”), in each case less
(a)&nbsp;the amount of any undrawnfunding commitments the Company
has under any loan asset and which are not covered by amounts in
the Unfunded Exposure Account referred to below (the “Unfunded
Exposure Amount”) and outstanding borrowings. Each loan asset held
by theCompany as of the date on which the Credit Facility was
closed was valued as of that date and each loan asset that the
Company acquires after such date will be valued at the lowest of
its fair value, its face value (excluding accrued interest) andthe
purchase price paid for such loan asset. Adjustments to the value
of a loan asset will be made to reflect, among other things,
changes in its fair value, a default by the obligor on the loan
asset, insolvency of the obligor, acceleration of theloan asset,
and certain modifications to the terms of the loan asset.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The Credit Facility contains limitations on the type of loan
assetsthat are “eligible” to be included in the Borrowing Base and
as to the concentration level of certain categories of loan assets
in the Borrowing Base such as restrictions on geographic and
industry concentrations, asset size and quality,payment frequency,
status and terms, average life, and collateral interests. In
addition, if an asset is to remain an “eligible” loan asset, the
Company may not make changes to the payment, amortization,
collateral and certain other termsof the loan assets without the
consent of the administrative agent that will either result in
subordination of the loan asset or be materially adverse to the
lenders.</p>
<p STYLE=

<i>Interest Rate and Fees.</i> Under the Credit Facility, funds are
borrowed from or throughcertain lenders at the greater of the
prevailing LIBOR rate and 1.00%, plus an applicable margin of
4.75%. At the Company’s option, funds may be borrowed based on an
alternative base rate, which in no event will be less than 2.00%,
and theapplicable margin over such alternative base rate is 3.75%.
In addition, the Company pays the lenders a commitment fee of 0.75%
per year on the unused amount of the Credit Facility for the
duration of the Revolving Period (defined below). Accruedinterest
and commitment fees are payable monthly. The Company was also
obligated to pay certain other fees to the lenders in connection

insufficient, collections of interest from the loan assets,
beapplied on each payment date to payment of outstanding borrowings
if the Borrowing Base Test, the Overcollateralization Ratio and the
Interest Coverage Ratio would not otherwise be met. Similarly,
following termination of the Revolving Period,collections of
interest are required to be applied, after payment of certain fees
and expenses, to cure any deficiencies in the Borrowing Base Test,

set aside an amount equal to the sum of accrued interest,
commitmentfees and administrative agent fees due and payable on the
next succeeding three payment dates (or corresponding to three
payment periods). If for any monthly period during which fees and
other payments accrue, the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing Valueof 
“eligible” pledged loan assets which do not pay cash interest at
least quarterly exceeds 15.0% of the aggregate Adjusted Borrowing
Value of “eligible” pledged loan assets, the Company is required to
set aside such interest andfees due and payable on the next
succeeding six payment dates. Amounts in the reserve account can be
applied solely to the payment of administrative agent fees,
commitment fees, accrued and unpaid interest and any breakage costs
payable to thelenders.</p>

delayed draw loan assets, the Company is required to set aside ina
designated account (the “Unfunded Exposure Account”) 100.0% of its
outstanding and undrawn funding commitments with respect to such
loan assets. The Unfunded Exposure Account is funded at the time
the Company acquires a revolver ordelayed draw loan asset and
requests a related borrowing under the Credit Facility. The
Unfunded Exposure Account is funded through a combination of
proceeds of the requested borrowing and other Company funds, and if
for any reason such amounts areinsufficient, through application of
the priority of payment provisions described above.</p>

On April&nbsp;2, 2015, the SBA issued a “green light” letter
inviting the Company tocontinue our application process to obtain a
license to form and operate its second SBIC subsidiary. On
September&nbsp;27, 2016, the SBA informed us that as part of their
continued review of our application for a second license, and in
order toensure that they were reviewing the most current
information available, we would need to update all previously
submitted materials and invited us to reapply. As a result of this
request, with which we are in the process of complying, the
existing“green light” letter that the SBA issued to us has expired.
If approved in the future, a second SBIC license would provide us
an incremental source of long-term capital by permitting us to

debentures in addition to the $150.0&nbsp;million already approved

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Our business activities contain elements of market risk. We
consider our principal market risk to be the fluctuation in
interest rates.Managing this risk is essential to our business.
Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify
and analyze our risks, to establish appropriate policies and
thresholds and to continually monitor this risk and thresholds by
means ofadministrative and information technology systems and other
policies and processes.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity ofour current and
future earnings to interest rate volatility, including relative
changes in different interest rates, variability of spread
relationships, the difference in <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">re-pricing</font> intervals between ourassets
and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our
cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can
affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the
interest income earned on interest earningassets and our interest
expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and
liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other
things, our ability to acquire leveraged loans, high yield bonds
and other debt investmentsand the value of our investment
portfolio.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various
interest rates, including LIBORand the prime rate. A large portion
of our portfolio is, and we expect will continue to be, comprised
of floating rate investments that utilize LIBOR. Our interest
expense is affected by fluctuations in LIBOR only on our revolving
credit facility.At February&nbsp;28, 2018, we had
$212.1&nbsp;million of borrowings outstanding. There were no
borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of
February&nbsp;28, 2018.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates
on interest income from investments. Assuming that our investments
as ofFebruary&nbsp;28, 2018 were to remain constant for a full
fiscal year and no actions were taken to alter the existing
interest rate terms, a hypothetical change of 1.0% in interest
rates would cause a corresponding increase of
approximately$2.3&nbsp;million to our interest income.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our
sensitivity to interestrate changes, it does not adjust for
potential changes in credit quality, size and composition of the
assets on the statements of assets and liabilities and other
business developments that could magnify or diminish our
sensitivity to interest ratechanges, nor does it account for
divergences in LIBOR and the commercial paper rate, which have
historically moved in tandem but, in times of unusual credit
dislocations, have experienced periods of divergence. Accordingly
no assurances can be giventhat actual results would not materially
differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate.</p>

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
ourmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">13a-15(e)</font> and 15d-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures
areeffective in facilitating timely decisions regarding required
disclosure of any material information relating to us that is
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit

the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and managementnecessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship

defined inRules <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">13a-15(f)</font>
and <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">15d-15(f)</font> of the
Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to themaintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are
recorded as necessary to permitpreparation of financial statements
in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that the receipts and

authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii)&nbsp;providereasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
internalcontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that thedegree of
compliance with polices or procedures may deteriorate.</p>

In accordance with rules of the NYSE, the board of directors
annually determines the independence of each director. Nodirector
is considered independent unless the board of directors has
determined that he or she has no material relationship with the
Company. The Company monitors the status of its directors and
officers through the activities of the Company’sNominating and
Corporate Governance Committee and through a questionnaire to be
completed by each director no less frequently than annually, with
updates periodically if information provided in the most recent
questionnaire has changed.</p>

<b>Definition andLimitations of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting</b></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to providereasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2)&nbsp;providereasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that couldhave a material
effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent ordetect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies orprocedures may deteriorate.</p>

continuedreview of our application for a second license, and in
order to ensure that they were reviewing the most current
information available, we would need to update all previously
submitted materials and invited us to reapply. As a result of
thisrequest, with which we are in the process of complying, the

fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair
valuemeasurements. ASC 820 requires the Company to assume that its
investments are to be sold at the balance sheet date in the
principal market to independent market participants, or in the
absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous
market,which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are
defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous

The Company’s investment in Saratoga Investment Corp. CLO 2013-1,
Ltd. (“Saratoga CLO”) is carried at fair value, which is based on a
discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment, <font STYLE=

on historical experience and projected performance, economic
factors, the characteristics of the underlying cash flow, and
comparable yields for equity interests in collateralized loan
obligation funds similar to Saratoga CLO, when available,as
determined by our Manager and recommended to our board of
directors. Specifically, we use Intex cash flow models, or an
appropriate substitute, to form the basis for the valuation of our
investment in Saratoga CLO. The models use a set ofassumptions
including projected default rates, recovery rates, reinvestment
rates and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated
valuations. The assumptions are based on available market data and
projections provided by third parties as wellas management
estimates. The Company uses the output from the Intex models (i.e.,
the estimated cash flows) to perform a discounted cash flow
analysis on expected future cash flows to determine a valuation for
our investment in Saratoga CLO.</p>

Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private

these investments existed. The Company’s net asset valuecould be
materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value

In order to qualify as a RIC, among other requirements, the Company
is required to timely distribute to itsstockholders at least 90.0%
of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code,
for each fiscal tax year. The Company will be subject to a
nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax of 4.0% on undistributed
income if it does not distributeat least 98.0% of its ordinary
income in any calendar year and 98.2% of its capital gain net
income for each <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-year</font>
period ending on October 31.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the
Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of
currentyear dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a
4.0% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the
Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable
income will be in excess of estimated current yeardividend
distributions for excise tax purposes, the Company accrues excise
tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income
is earned.</p>

In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Treasury regulations and
private letter rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service(“IRS”
), a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling
its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to
receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of
the RIC subject to a limitation onthe aggregate amount of cash to
be distributed to all stockholders, which limitation must be at
least 20.0% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many
stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to
receive cash willreceive a pro rata amount of cash (with the
balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any
stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20.0% of
his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain
otherrequirements are met, for U.S federal income tax purposes, the
amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of
cash that could have been received instead of stock.</p>

ASC 740, <i>Income Taxes</i>, (“ASC 740”), provides guidance for

deemed to meet a <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">

pricesor for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted
prices generally will have a higher degree of market price
observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring
fair value.</p>

Based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation
techniques, the Company is required to provide disclosures on fair
valuemeasurements according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair
value hierarchy ranks the observability of the inputs used to
determine fair values. Investments carried at fair value are
classified and disclosed in one of the following
threecategories:</p>

On January&nbsp;22, 2008, the Company invested$30.0&nbsp;million in
all of the outstanding subordinated notes of GSC Investment Corp.
CLO 2007, Ltd., a collateralized loan obligation fund managed by
the Company that invests primarily in senior secured loans.
Additionally, the Company enteredinto a collateral management
agreement with GSC Investment Corp. CLO 2007, Ltd. pursuant to
which we act as collateral manager to it. The Saratoga CLO was
initially refinanced in October 2013 and its reinvestment period
ended in October 2016. OnNovember&nbsp;15, 2016, the Company
completed the second refinancing of the Saratoga CLO. The Saratoga
CLO refinancing, among other things, extended its reinvestment
period to October 2018, and extended its legal maturity date to
October 2025.Following the refinancing, the Saratoga CLO portfolio
remained at the same size and with a similar capital structure of
approximately $300.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of
predominantly senior secured first lien term loans. Inaddition to
refinancing its liabilities, we also purchased $4.5&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of the Class&nbsp;F notes tranche of the
Saratoga CLO at par, with a coupon of LIBOR plus 8.5%.</p>
<p STYLE=

The Saratoga CLO remains 100.0% owned and managed by Saratoga
Investment Corp. Following the refinancing, the Company receives a
basemanagement fee of 0.10% and a subordinated management fee of
0.40% of the fee basis amount at the beginning of the collection
period, paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds. The
Company is also entitled to an incentive management feeequal to
20.0% of excess cash flow to the extent the Saratoga CLO
subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return paid in cash
equal to or greater than 12.0%. For the years ended
February&nbsp;28, 2018, February&nbsp;28, 2017 andFebruary&nbsp;29,
2016, we accrued $1.5&nbsp;million, $1.5&nbsp;million and
$1.5&nbsp;million in management fee income, respectively, and
$2.4&nbsp;million, $1.9&nbsp;million and $2.7&nbsp;million in
interest income, respectively, from Saratoga CLO.For the year ended
February&nbsp;28, 2018, we accrued $0.6&nbsp;million related to the
incentive management fee from Saratoga CLO. For the years ended
February&nbsp;28, 2017 and February&nbsp;29, 2016, we did not
accrue any amounts related to theincentive management fee from
Saratoga CLO as the 12.0% hurdle rate had not yet been
achieved.</p>

As of February&nbsp;28, 2018, the Companydetermined that the fair
value of its investment in the subordinated notes of Saratoga CLO
was $11.9&nbsp;million. The Company determines the fair value of

the present value of theprojected future cash flows of the
subordinated notes over the life of Saratoga CLO. At

spread over LIBOR of 3.9%, and haddebt with a principal balance of
$282.4&nbsp;million with a weighted average spread over LIBOR of
2.4%. As a result, Saratoga CLO earns a “spread” between the
interest income it receives on its investments and the interest
expense it payson its debt and other operating expenses, which is
distributed quarterly to the Company as the holder of its
subordinated notes. At February&nbsp;28, 2018, the present value of
the projected future cash flows of the subordinated notes,
wasapproximately $12.2&nbsp;million, using a 15.0% discount rate.

The Company is subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax
of 4.0% on undistributed income if it doesnot distribute at least
98% of its ordinary income in any calendar year and 98.2% of its
capital gain net income for each <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">one-year</font> period ending on
October&nbsp;31 of such calendar year. Depending on the levelof
Investment Company Taxable Income (“ICTI”) earned in a tax year,
the Company may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current
year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4.0%
excise tax on such income, as required.To the extent that the
Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable
income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend
distributions for excise tax purposes, the Company accrues excise
tax, if any, on estimated excesstaxable income as taxable income is
earned. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end
of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing
the final tax return related to the year which generated such
ICTI.</p>

Management has analyzed the Company’s tax positions taken on

On December&nbsp;22, 2010, the Regulated Investment Company
Modernization Act of 2010 (the “Modernization Act”) was enacted,
and theprovisions with the Modernization Act are effective for the
Company for the year ended February&nbsp;29, 2012. The
Modernization Act is the first major piece of legislation affecting
RICs since 1986 and it modernizes several of the federal incomeand
excise tax provisions related to RICs. Some highlights of the
enacted provisions are as follows:</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
New capital losses may now becarried forward indefinitely, and
retain the character of the original loss. Under <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">pre-enactment</font> law, capital losses could
be carried forward for eight years, and carried forward as
short-term capital,irrespective of the character of the original
loss.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The Modernization Act contains simplification provisions, which are
aimed atpreventing disqualification of a RIC for “inadvertent”
failures of the asset diversification and/or qualifying income
tests. Additionally, the Modernization Act exempts RICs from the
preferential dividend rule, and repealed the 60-day designation
requirement for certain types of <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">pay-through</font> income and gains.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Finally, the Modernization Act contains several provisions aimed at
preserving the character of distributions made by a fiscal year RIC
duringthe portion of its taxable year ending after October&nbsp;31
or December&nbsp;31, reducing the circumstances under which a RIC
might be required to file amended Forms 1099 to restate previously
reported distributions.</p>

Our Manager is responsible for, among other duties, determining
investment criteria, sourcing, analyzingand executing investments
transactions, asset sales, financings and performing asset
management duties. Under the Management Agreement, we have agreed
to pay our Manager a management fee for investment advisory and
management services consisting ofa base management fee and an
incentive fee.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The base management fee of 1.75% is calculated based on the average
value of our gross assets(other than cash or cash equivalents, but
including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the
two most recently completed fiscal quarters.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The incentive fee consists of the following two parts:</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The first, payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of our
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee net
investment income,expressed as a rate of return on the value of our
net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, that
exceeds a 1.875% quarterly hurdle rate measured as of the end of
each fiscal quarter, subject to a<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">
“catch-up”</font> provision. Under this provision, in any fiscal
quarter, our Manager receives no incentive fee unless our
<font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee net
investment incomeexceeds the hurdle rate of 1.875%. Our Manager
will receive 100.0% of <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee net investment
income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or
equal to 2.344% in any fiscal quarter;and 20.0% of the amount of
the our <font STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-incentive</font> fee
net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.344% in any fiscal
quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate
from quarter to quarter,and accordingly there is no claw back of
amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the
quarterly hurdle rate, and there is no delay of payment if prior
quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in
arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of
theManagement Agreement) and equals 20.0% of our “incentive fee
capital gains,” which equals our realized capital gains on a
cumulative basis from May&nbsp;31, 2010 through the end of the
fiscal year, if any, computed net of all realizedcapital losses and
unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the
aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee.
Importantly, the capital gains portion of the incentive fee is
based on realized gains andrealized and unrealized losses from
May&nbsp;31, 2010. Therefore, realized and unrealized losses
incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when
calculating the capital gains portion of the incentive fee, and our
Manager will beentitled to 20.0% of incentive fee capital gains
that arise after May&nbsp;31, 2010. In addition, for the purpose of
the “incentive fee capital gains” calculations, the cost basis for
computing realized gains and losses on investments heldby us as of
May&nbsp;31, 2010 will equal the fair value of such investments as
of such date.</p>

The Credit Facility contains limitations as to how borrowed funds
may be used, such as restrictions onindustry concentrations, asset
size, weighted average life, currency denomination and collateral
interests. The Credit Facility also includes certain requirements
relating to portfolio performance, the violation of which could
result in the limit offurther advances and, in some cases, result
in an event of default, allowing the lenders to accelerate
repayment of amounts owed thereunder. The Credit Facility has an
eight year term, consisting of a three year period (the 
“RevolvingPeriod”), under which the Company may make and repay
borrowings, and a final maturity five years from the end of the
Revolving Period. Availability on the Credit Facility will be
subject to a borrowing base calculation, based on, among
otherthings, applicable advance rates (which vary from 50.0% to
75.0% of par or fair value depending on the type of loan asset) and
the value of certain “eligible” loan assets included as part of the
Borrowing Base. Funds may be borrowed at thegreater of the

SBIC LP is able toborrow funds from the SBA against regulatory
capital (which approximates equity capital) that is paid in and is
subject to customary regulatory requirements including but not
limited to an examination by the SBA. As of February&nbsp;28, 2018,
wehave funded SBIC LP with $75.0&nbsp;million of equity capital,
and have $137.7&nbsp;million of <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">SBA-guaranteed</font> debentures outstanding.
SBA debentures are <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">non-recourse</font> tous, have a <font STYLE=
"white-space:nowrap">10-year</font> maturity, and may be prepaid at
any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA debentures is
fixed at the time of issuance, often referred to as pooling, at a
market-driven spread over 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes. SBA current
regulations limit the amount that SBIC LP may borrow to a maximum
of $150.0&nbsp;million, which is up to twice its potential
regulatory capital.</p>

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital
to eligible small businesses.Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make
loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity
securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations,
eligible small businesses include businesses that have a tangible
net worth notexceeding $19.5&nbsp;million and have average annual
fully taxed net income not exceeding $6.5&nbsp;million for the two
most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote 25.0% of
its investment activity to ‘‘smaller’’concerns as defined by the
SBA. A smaller concern is one that has a tangible net worth not
exceeding $6.0&nbsp;million and has average annual fully taxed net
income not exceeding $2.0&nbsp;million for the two most recent
fiscal years. SBAregulations also provide alternative size standard
criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in
which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the
number of employees and gross sales. According to SBAregulations,
SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the
equity securities of such businesses and provide them with
consulting and advisory services.</p>

The Company receivedexemptive relief from the SEC to permit it to
exclude the debt of SBIC LP guaranteed by the SBA from the
definition of senior securities in the 200.0% asset coverage test
under the 1940 Act. This allows the Company increased flexibility
under the200.0% asset coverage test by permitting it to borrow up
to $150.0&nbsp;million more than it would otherwise be able to

On April&nbsp;2, 2015, the SBA issued a “green light” letter
inviting the Company to continue the application process to obtain
alicense to form and operate its second SBIC subsidiary. On
September&nbsp;27, 2016, the SBA informed us that as part of their
continued review of our application for a second license, and in
order to ensure that they were reviewing the most
currentinformation available, we would need to update all
previously submitted materials and invited us to reapply. As a
result of this request, with which we are in the process of
complying, the existing “green light” letter that the SBA issuedto

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles(“U.S.
GAAP”) and are stated in U.S. dollars. The following is a summary
of the significant accounting policies followed by the Issuer in
the preparation of its financial statements.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The Issuer is considered to be an investment company for financial
reporting purposes and has applied the guidance in accordance with
theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, <i>“Financial Services—
Investment Companies.”</i> There has been no change to the Issuer’s

<i>Use of Estimates</i></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires the Investment Manager to make estimates and
assumptions thataffect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, including the
fair value of investments, and the amounts of income and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
theseestimates and such differences could be material.</p>

<i>Cash and Cash Equivalents</i></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The Issuer defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid
financial instruments with original maturities of three months or
less. Cash andcash equivalents may include investments in money
market mutual funds, which are carried at fair value. At
February&nbsp;28, 2018 and February&nbsp;28, 2017, cash and cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”

<i>Restricted Cash</i> (“ASU <font STYLE=

"white-space:nowrap">2016-18</font> requires that thestatements of
cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of
cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as
restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts
generally described as restricted cash andrestricted cash
equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when

<i>Valuation of Investments</i></p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
The Issueraccounts for its investments at fair value in accordance
with the FASB ASC Topic 820, <i>Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures</i> (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes afair
value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair
value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
measurements. ASC 820 requires the Issuer to assume that its
investments are to be sold at the statement of assets
andliabilities date in the principal market to independent market
participants, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most
advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market
participants are defined as buyers and sellers in theprincipal or
most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and
willing and able to transact.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Investments for which marketquotations are readily available are
fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent
third party pricing services and market makers subject to any
decision by the Investment Manager to approve a fair value
determination to reflectsignificant events affecting the value of
these investments. The Investment Manager values investments for
which market quotations are not readily available at fair value.
Determinations of fair value may involve significant judgments and
estimates.The types of factors that may be considered in
determining the fair value of investments include the nature and
realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability
to make payments, market yield trend analysis, the markets inwhich
the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded
companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors.</p>
<p STYLE=
"margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private
investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain, they
mayfluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on
estimates. The determination of fair value may differ materially
from the values that would have been used if a ready market for
these investments existed. Our net asset value could bematerially
affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our
investments were materially higher or lower than the values that
are ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.</p>

adjusted foramortization of premium and accretion of discount, is
recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are
expected to be collected. The Issuer stops accruing interest on its
investments when it is determined that interest is no
longercollectible. Discounts and premiums on investments purchased
are accreted/amortized over the life of the respective investment
using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments
represents the original cost adjusted for theaccretion of discounts
and amortizations of premium on investments.</p>

Taxes</i>, the Issuer adopted the provisions of the FASB relating
toaccounting for uncertainty in income taxes which clarifies the
accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the
financial statements and applies to all open taxyears as of the
effective date. The Investment Manager has analyzed such tax
positions for uncertain tax positions for tax years that may be
open (2015—2018). The Issuer identifies its major tax jurisdictions
as U.S. Federal, state and foreignjurisdictions where the Issuer
makes investments. As of February&nbsp;28, 2018 and
February&nbsp;28, 2017, there was no impact to the financial
statements as a result of the Issuer’s accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes. The Issuer doesnot have any unrecognized tax
benefits or liabilities for the years ended February 28, 2018,
