Legal Proceedings<br> <p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> The Company may be subject to various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the matters discussed below, the Company is not aware of any current pending legal matters or claims, individually or in the aggregate, that are expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> In January 2016, Mendocino Wine Group (“MWG”) filed a complaint against Phillip Hurst and the LLC alleging breach of fiduciary duty, interference with contract, and interference with economic advantage. On November 10, 2016, the Sonoma County Superior Court granted MWG’s Motion to Consolidate the Hurst/LLC case with a second complaint MWG filed against a law firm for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. On November 20, 2017, the Sonoma County Superior Court granted Phillip Hurst and the LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment to dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty claim. MWG has dismissed the other two causes of action. The plaintiff, MWG, had until February 2018 to appeal the Court’s decision. This matter is now closed and a final disbursement from the trust account related to the settlement was received in April 2018 in the amount of $10,000.</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> The results for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 include <font style="color:#000000;">payments totaling $1.0 million and a net gain of $0.8 million related to the settlement of certain litigation and termination of a leased facility.</font></p>
