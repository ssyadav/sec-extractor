Controls and Procedures<br> <p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> Management's Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report.&nbsp; Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provide reasonable assurance, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:18pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> Changes to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:18pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls</p><p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance due to its inherent limitations: it is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human or other failures. A control system also can be circumvented in various ways, including, without limitation, by collusion or improper management override. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of such limitations, disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting cannot prevent or detect all misstatements, including, without limitation, unintentional errors or fraud. Because these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, it is possible to design and implement process safeguards to reduce such risk, however, such risk cannot be completely eliminated. As such, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements, including without limitation, unintentional errors and fraud.</p><p style="text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> 27</p><hr style="page-break-after:always;width:100%;"><p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:11pt;"> &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> <a name="PART_II_OR_INFORMATION" id="PART_II_OR_INFORMATION"></a><font style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"><a name="PART_II_OR_INFORMATION" id="PART_II_OR_INFORMATION"></a>PART II – OTH</font><font style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;">ER INFORMATION</font></p>
