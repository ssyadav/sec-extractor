<body>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.<br> <p style="margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in marketable securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. However, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant as the majority of our investments are short-term in duration and due to the low risk profile of our investments, a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the total market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments.</p><p style="margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> As of March&nbsp;31, 2018, we held $43.5&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollar assets, and consisting primarily of investments in reverse repurchase agreements and U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;government securities.</p>
