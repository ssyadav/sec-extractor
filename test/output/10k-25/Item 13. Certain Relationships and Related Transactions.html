<body>13 : Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions<br> <p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:5px; MARGIN-TOP:5px" align="justify">A total of 3,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.</p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:5px; MARGIN-TOP:5px" align="justify">There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. Our stock may become quoted, rather than traded, on the OTCBB.</p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:5px; MARGIN-TOP:5px" align="justify">There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into our common stock. There is one holder of record for our common stock. The record holder is our sole officer and director who own 3,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock.</p><p style="MARGIN:5px" align="justify"><br></p>
