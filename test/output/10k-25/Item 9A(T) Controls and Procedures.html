The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 using the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").</p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify">A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.</p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; WIDTH:39px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:15px"> 1.</p><p style="PADDING-LEFT:39px; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px" align="justify">We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’ s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.</p><p style="CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; WIDTH:39px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:15px"> 2.</p><p style="PADDING-LEFT:39px; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px" align="justify">We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of January 31, 2018, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company’s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.</p><p style="CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:-2px; WIDTH:39px; FLOAT:left; MARGIN-TOP:0px; TEXT-INDENT:15px"> 3.</p><p style="PADDING-LEFT:39px; MARGIN:0px; TEXT-INDENT:-2px" align="justify">We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As at January 31, 2018, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.</p><p style="CLEAR:left; MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify">Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.</p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify">As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.</p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify"><b><i>System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</i></b></p><p style="MARGIN:0px; LINE-HEIGHT:12pt" align="justify"><br></p><p style="MARGIN:0px" align="justify">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
