<body>7 : Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.<br> <p style="margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:9pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> Market risks relating to the Company's operations result primarily from changes in interest rates. Collectively, the Company's exposure to market risk factors is not significant and has not materially changed from February 25, 2017.</p><p style="margin-top:12pt;border-bottom:Solid 1.5pt #0054A0;padding-bottom:1pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;font-family:Arial;letter-spacing:-0.15pt;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> Interest Rate Risk</p><p style="margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:9pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;"> The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate debt. The expected interest rate exposure on the Companyâ€™s Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility and industrial revenue bonds is based upon variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market interest rates. As of March 3, 2018, the Company had $199.9 million (net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs) in long-term debt outstanding related to its Term Loan Facility and industrial revenue bonds and no cash borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company expects to pay interest totaling approximately $10.2 million per year on the Term Loan Facility based upon rates in effect at the end of fiscal 2018. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would result in approximately $2.0 million of additional interest expense per year under the Term Loan Facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-family:Times New Roman;"> &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;font-variant: small-caps;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;"> 31</p><hr style="page-break-after:always;width:100%;">
